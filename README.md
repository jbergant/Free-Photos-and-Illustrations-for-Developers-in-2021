You are a developer with great ideas that you know how to turn into a reality, but you lack design skills.

A good illustration or a representative image can illustrate the entire purpose of the product or service without a lengthy description no one wants to read.

Thank god, things have changed in the last decade or two. You don’t need to study design; you don’t need to hire a designer. You can find great FREE illustrations and photos on the internet.

Here is a list of my resources: free photos and free illustrations. The first few will be my favorite ones. I listed the following without any order.
